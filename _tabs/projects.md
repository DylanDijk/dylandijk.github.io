## Created the [CTVsuggest](https://dylandijk.github.io/CTVsuggest/) and [CTVsuggestTrain](https://dylandijk.github.io/CTVsuggestTrain/) R Packages.  
  - The **CTVsuggest** R package outputs suggestions for packages to be added to CRAN Task Views.
  - The **CTVsuggestTrain** R package carries out the model building process.

  These R packages are based on follow up work of my 4<sup>th</sup> year university [dissertation](https://dylandijk.github.io/assets/pdf/Dissertation.pdf).

  The functionality of the CTVsuggest package was announced by [Achim Zeileis](https://www.zeileis.org/) to the CRAN Task View maintainers, on the 22<sup>nd</sup> of March 2023.

  **Michael Dewey**, maintainer of the [MetaAnalysis](https://github.com/cran-task-views/MetaAnalysis) Task View, wrote:

  > "Just for your info of the top twenty for MetaAnalysis five 
  were definitely relevant and all occurred in the top ten. 
  At least three of these have been in the CTV at some point 
  but fallen off CRAN and then come back. It also found two 
  more which I think are of peripheral relevance. I will 
  have a think about them."

  These two commits were made: [Commit 1](https://github.com/cran-task-views/MetaAnalysis/commit/f088a31930fee9df30979ad89a372a9e187d1ad7) and [Commit 2](https://github.com/cran-task-views/MetaAnalysis/commit/223e53f521ed7af137de5a745f9a9dfcab1e565a) afte the package announcement.
