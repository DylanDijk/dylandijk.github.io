## Created the [CTVsuggest](https://dylandijk.github.io/CTVsuggest/) and [CTVsuggestTrain](https://dylandijk.github.io/CTVsuggestTrain/) R Packages.  
  - The **CTVsuggest** R package outputs suggestions for packages to be added to CRAN Task Views.
  - The **CTVsuggestTrain** R package carries out the model building process.

  These R packages are based on follow up work of my 4<sup>th</sup> year university [dissertation](https://dylandijk.github.io/assets/pdf/Dissertation.pdf).

  The functionality of the CTVsuggest package was announced by [Achim Zeileis](https://www.zeileis.org/) to the CRAN Task View maintainers, on the 22<sup>nd</sup> of March 2023, and was cited in [this report](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17573) describing the transfer of the Task View management to GitHub. Since the release, the package has been frequently used by maintainers, with examples given below.

Feedback just after the release in 22/03/23:

  **Michael Dewey**, maintainer of the [MetaAnalysis](https://github.com/cran-task-views/MetaAnalysis) Task View, wrote:

  > "Just for your info of the top twenty for MetaAnalysis five 
  were definitely relevant and all occurred in the top ten. 
  At least three of these have been in the CTV at some point 
  but fallen off CRAN and then come back. It also found two 
  more which I think are of peripheral relevance. I will 
  have a think about them."

  These two commits were made: [Commit 1](https://github.com/cran-task-views/MetaAnalysis/commit/f088a31930fee9df30979ad89a372a9e187d1ad7) and [Commit 2](https://github.com/cran-task-views/MetaAnalysis/commit/223e53f521ed7af137de5a745f9a9dfcab1e565a) afte the package announcement.

  

  **Bill Denney**, maintainer of the [Pharmacokinetics](https://github.com/cran-task-views/Pharmacokinetics) Task View, wrote:

  > "Thanks for the package.  I just updated the Pharmacokinetics CTV using it,
and it provided a list of several more packages that I was not aware of."

A [commit](https://github.com/cran-task-views/Pharmacokinetics/commit/f841bfaa399e211edca71fdffee973b3ff5c5acc) was made.

## Tail-robust estimation of factor-adjusted vector autoregressive models for high-dimensional time series

As part of my PhD, alongside my supervisor [Haeran Cho](https://sites.google.com/view/haeran-cho/home), we wrote a paper proposing a methodology to model high-dimensional time-series which can handle heavy-tailed data. The prepint is available [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22235), and the corresponding code [here](https://github.com/DylanDijk/truncFVAR).
