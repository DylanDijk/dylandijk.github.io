# R Package

## Vignette

  - To start new vignette `usethis::use_vignette("vignette-name")`
    - There also exists `usethis::use_article("vignette-name")` which creates an article, this is similar to a vignette but it is added to `.Rbuildignore`. Therefore it is not part of the packages source code, but it will appear in `pkgdown` sites.
