$$
\begin{align*}
\|Ax\|_2 \leq \|A\|_F \|x\|_2
\end{align*}
$$

According to [this answer](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1681041/does-the-concept-of-submultiplicative-norm-make-sense-for-non-square-matrix?rq=1) operator norms (induced norms) are submultiplicative. This means that for any two matrices $A$ and $B$,

$$
\begin{align*}
\|AB\| \leq \|A\| \|B\|
\end{align*}
$$
