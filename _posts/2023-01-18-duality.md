In this document I give the main results for duality in optimisation problems.

# Standard form:

minimize  $f_0(x)$  
subject to  $f_i(x)  â‰¤0,  i  = 1,...,m$  
$h_i(x) = 0,  i  = 1,...,p$


Since the dual function is the pointwise infimum of a family of affine functions of $(\lambda,\nu)$, it is concave, even when the problem (5.1) is not convex.
