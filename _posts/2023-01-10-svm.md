# Introduction

## Linear Decision Rule
We are in the binary classification setup, and we want to create a linear decision rule that when given a feature vector we predict the class it belongs to. What we mean by a linear decision rule, is that the decision rule will be based on some activation function of an affine combinantion of our features.

In particular, for now we will define our decision rule as:

$$\begin{align} \label{eq:binary linear classifier}
    f(\bx) &= 
     \begin{cases}
       +1, &\quad g(\bx;\bw) \geq 0 
       \\
       -1, &\quad g(\bx;\bw) < 0 
     \end{cases} \\
     \text{Where } g(\bx;\bw) &= \langle \bw',\bx \rangle + w_0 \nonumber
\end{align}$$

_In other words, this is the step function activation function applied to the affine function of our features_ $g(\bx;\bw)$

### Decision Boundary Geometry

Before we introduce Support Vector Machines (SVM), I will list some geometric facts related to the decision boundary.

The decision boundary is the set $$

## SVM Motivation

The perceptron algorithm chooses the value of $\bw$ by applying gradient ascent iteratively on observations that are miss-classified. If the data is linearly separable, it can be shown that the perceptron algorithm will find a solution (decision rule
where all points correctly classified) in a finite number of steps.

However, if the data is linearly separable there will be an infinite number of choices for a decision boundary.  
Our objective is to find the decision boundary that generalizes "best" to unseen data, Support Vector Machines (SVM) tries to solve this problem.

## High Level Description of SVM

SVMs find the decision boundary that is furthest away from the closest points. Or in other words, it is searching for the decision boundary that maximises the minimum distance of feature vectors to the decision boundary.
